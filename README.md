# My Study From Following FreeCodeCamp

This repository is made to keep a record that I have done and learned from FreeCodeCamp. Firstly I used a gist for my note but I decided to use a wiki for convenience of information delivery.

I will try to keep it updated when I complete each section of FreeCodeCamp. I will also add some notes related to a section if I want to get additional information.
